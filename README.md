## 💡 Projects

### 🔹 Drowsiness Detector  
Software-based implementation of a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier in Python, leveraging a laptop’s integrated camera. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for real-time image processing and pattern recognition tasks. The system detects facial features to monitor signs of drowsiness and alert the user.

### 🔹 Smart Energy Meter  
Designed to monitor and manage electricity usage using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system uses SCT-013 and ACS712 sensors for current measurement and ZMPT101B for voltage. Real-time data is processed and transmitted to Firebase, and automatically logged in Google Sheets using Google Scripts. The data is accessible through a web interface for user-friendly tracking and analysis of power consumption.

### 🔹 Implementing the General Matrix Multiplication (GeMM) Algorithm on FPGA  
Implemented the GeMM algorithm on an FPGA using Verilog and a Finite State Machine (FSM) design methodology. The system processes two 3×3 matrices stored in BRAM, performs the multiplication operation, and stores the result back into BRAM. The operation is controlled through an external switch. The FSM-based design helps reduce complexity and improves efficiency for hardware-accelerated matrix computations.

### 🔹 Hardware Acceleration of Convolution Operation Using GeMM Algorithm on FPGA  
Developed an efficient convolution engine using the GeMM algorithm and FSM architecture in Verilog for processing 224×224 grayscale images. Three separate BRAM modules store the input image, convolution kernel, and output. The FSM extracts patches using the im2col method and performs signed matrix multiplication using GeMM. Deployed on platforms including Boolean Board, Zynq ZedBoard, and Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU104. Future improvements include support for IEEE 754 16-bit floating-point representation to enhance accuracy.

### 🔹 Implementing UART Transmission Module on FPGA  
Built a UART transmission system to visualize 2D convolution results computed on an FPGA. A BRAM reader module retrieves processed data, which is then transmitted via UART to a local computer. A Python script receives and reconstructs the image for visualization. This enabled debugging and performance assessment of convolution accelerators.

### 🔹 Booth Multiplier on FPGA  
Implemented a signed Booth multiplier using Verilog, integrated into a custom Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) design. The Booth algorithm enables efficient multiplication of signed binary numbers by reducing the number of partial products. This design significantly improves speed and resource utilization compared to conventional multipliers and is optimized for FPGA-based digital signal processing applications.

### 🔹 Reconfigurable Hardware Accelerator for AI Models  
Designing a reconfigurable hardware accelerator in Verilog for AI models like LeNet, MobileNet, and TinyYOLOv3. The project is part of the C2S initiative and focuses on building an FPGA-based anomaly detection engine. The architecture supports flexible reconfiguration of compute units for different model types and uses optimized BRAM management for efficient data handling. Deployed on high-performance platforms like Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU104, this design targets low-latency inference with minimal resource overhead.
